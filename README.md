### Hint
This plugin works best with WordPress themes utilizing the Bootstrap Framework. If your Theme doesn't use it, you might end up having to tweak it here and there a bit.
Works best with the [EVE Online WordPress Theme](https://github.com/ppfeufer/eve-online-wordpress-theme)

### Requirements
- WordPress 4.7 or newer
- PHP 7
- PHP Library "ZipArchive" needs to be installed

### Installation
- Simply [download the archive](https://github.com/ppfeufer/eve-online-killboard-widget/archive/master.zip) or one of the [releases](https://github.com/ppfeufer/eve-online-killboard-widget/releases)
